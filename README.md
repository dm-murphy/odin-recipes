## What Was Learned

This was a review of HTML and a way to see how the new Foundations course at The Odin Project is teaching HTML. This is a very simple assignment for learners but it does reinforce the process of building a website and using Git. Please forgive the odd styling here as part of the assignment is to play with various CSS properties regardless of color or design choices.
